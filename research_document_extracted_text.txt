INTRODUCTION
 
PROJECT
 
CONTEXT
 
 
In
 
today’ s
 
educational
 
landscape,
 
the
 
integration
 
of
 
advanced
 
technologies
 
plays
 
a
 
big
 
role
 
in
 
improving
 
the
 
efficiency ,
 
accuracy ,
 
and
 
transparency
 
of
 
academic
 
processes.
 
However ,
 
many
 
schools
 
still
 
use
 
old-fashioned
 
ways
 
to
 
monitor
 
student
 
performance,
 
which
 
often
 
leads
 
to
 
mistakes
 
and
 
delays.
 
These
 
manual
 
systems
 
take
 
too
 
much
 
time
 
and
 
effort,
 
especially
 
for
 
teachers
 
who
 
are
 
already
 
managing
 
multiple
 
responsibilities.
 
This
 
makes
 
it
 
harder
 
to
 
track
 
students
 
progress
 
accurately
 
and
 
give
 
the
 
right
 
support
 
at
 
the
 
right
 
time.
 
Because
 
of
 
this,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
system
 
that
 
can
 
help
 
schools
 
manage
 
academic
 
records
 
more
 
efficiently
 
and
 
effectively .
 
 
This
 
research
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
at
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy ,
 
located
 
in
 
Bayanan,
 
Muntinlupa
 
City,
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
Senior
 
High
 
School
 
department.
 
The
 
researchers
 
conducted
 
an
 
interview ,
 
and
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
school’ s
 
administrators
 
and
 
teachers,
 
their
 
current
 
process
 
often
 
causes
 
delays
 
and
 
makes
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
manage
 
student
 
records
 
properly .
 
Despite
 
using
 
a
 
computerized
 
system,
 
there
 
are
 
still
 
problems
 
with
 
recording
 
and
 
organizing
 
students'
 
academic
 
information.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
the
 
school
 
administrator
 
struggles
 
to
 
monitor
 
and
 
process
 
all
 
student
 
records
 
efficiently .
 
The
 
current
 
approach
 
is
 
also
 
time-consuming
 
for
 
both
 
administrators
 
and
 
teachers.
 
These
 
challenges
 
not
 
only
 
increase
 
the
 
teachers'
 
workload
 
but
 
also
 
slow
 
down
 
the
 
decision-making
 
process
 
when
 
students
 
need
 
support
 
or
 
are
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
failing.

The
 
main
 
problem
 
this
 
study
 
aims
 
to
 
solve
 
is
 
the
 
delay
 
and
 
user-friendly
 
system
 
to
 
monitor
 
student
 
performance.
 
The
 
current
 
manual
 
process
 
makes
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
keep
 
up,
 
especially
 
when
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
check
 
or
 
update
 
records
 
regularly .
 
This
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
late
 
interventions
 
for
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
struggling
 
and
 
may
 
even
 
affect
 
their
 
academic
 
success.
 
By
 
addressing
 
this
 
issue,
 
the
 
school
 
can
 
prevent
 
long-term
 
setbacks
 
and
 
improve
 
student
 
achievement.
 
It
 
also
 
allows
 
teachers
 
to
 
focus
 
more
 
on
 
teaching,
 
rather
 
than
 
spending
 
too
 
much
 
time
 
on
 
paperwork
 
or
 
constantly
 
reminding
 
students
 
about
 
their
 
academic
 
performance
 
status.
 
 
Addressing
 
this
 
problem
 
is
 
important
 
because
 
it
 
will
 
make
 
the
 
academic
 
monitoring
 
process
 
smoother ,
 
faster ,
 
and
 
more
 
accurate.
 
It
 
will
 
also
 
lessen
 
the
 
stress
 
and
 
workload
 
of
 
teachers
 
by
 
reducing
 
manual
 
tasks.
 
More
 
importantly ,
 
it
 
will
 
help
 
students
 
improve
 
because
 
teachers
 
can
 
easily
 
identify
 
those
 
students
 
who
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
reminded
 
about
 
their
 
academic
 
performance.
 
When
 
schools
 
use
 
better
 
systems,
 
it
 
benefits
 
everyone—teachers,
 
students,
 
and
 
even
 
parents
 
who
 
want
 
to
 
stay
 
informed
 
about
 
their
 
child’ s
 
performance.
 
This
 
study
 
proposes
 
a
 
smart
 
education
 
monitoring
 
system
 
that
 
will
 
track
 
student
 
performance
 
and
 
send
 
early
 
warning
 
alerts
 
when
 
needed.
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
web-based
 
and
 
easy
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
use.
 
They
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
log
 
in,
 
manage
 
records,
 
and
 
view
 
academic
 
data
 
anytime
 
through
 
a
 
secure
 
website.
 
This
 
solution
 
will
 
help
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy
 
manage
 
student
 
records
 
better ,
 
reduce
 
errors,
 
and
 
boost
 
productivity .
 
It
 
will
 
also
 
improve
 
communication
 
between
 
teachers
 
and
 
students,
 
making
 
the
 
learning
 
experience
 
more
 
effective
 
and
 
meaningful.

PURPOSE
 
AND
 
DESCRIPTION
 
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
teachers
 
and
 
school
 
administrators
 
monitor
 
student
 
academic
 
performance
 
more
 
efficiently .
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
web-based
 
academic
 
monitoring
 
tool
 
designed
 
for
 
the
 
Senior
 
High
 
School
 
teachers
 
of
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy .
 
It
 
will
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
track,
 
analyze,
 
and
 
manage
 
students'
 
grades
 
and
 
performance
 
in
 
using
 
the
 
system.
 
The
 
system
 
aims
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
difficulties
 
that
 
teachers
 
face
 
in
 
recording
 
and
 
checking
 
student
 
progress
 
every
 
grading
 
period.
 
 
This
 
system
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
an
 
easy-to-use
 
website
 
that
 
will
 
lessen
 
the
 
workload
 
of
 
teachers
 
by
 
providing
 
a
 
centralized
 
space
 
where
 
all
 
student
 
data
 
can
 
be
 
stored
 
and
 
updated.
 
Teachers
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
different
 
areas
 
of
 
student
 
performance,
 
helping
 
them
 
give
 
better
 
support
 
and
 
guidance.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
identify
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
struggling
 
and
 
need
 
help.
 
 
With
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
this
 
system,
 
teachers
 
can
 
complete
 
their
 
tasks
 
faster
 
and
 
with
 
fewer
 
mistakes
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
manual
 
method.
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
also
 
turn
 
data
 
into
 
simple
 
graphs
 
and
 
reports,
 
making
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
explain
 
student
 
progress.
 
This
 
will
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
make
 
better
 
decisions
 
when
 
giving
 
feedback
 
or
 
recommendations
 
for
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
performing
 
well.
 
 
Overall,
 
this
 
project
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
benefit
 
the
 
administrators
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
teachers
 
and
 
students
 
of
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy .
 
Teachers
 
will
 
save
 
time
 
and
 
effort,
 
while
 
students
 
will
 
better
 
understand
 
the
 
areas
 
where
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
improve.
 
The
 
system
 
is
 
built
 
to
 
be
 
user-friendly
 
so
 
that
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
easily .
 
By
 
using
 
this
 
system,
 
the
 
school
 
can
 
improve
 
how

it
 
manages
 
academic
 
records
 
and
 
support
 
better
 
learning
 
outcomes.
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
following
 
beneficiaries
 
who
 
will
 
benefited
 
the
 
system:
 
 
Administrator ,
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
help
 
the
 
administrator
 
to
 
manage
 
and
 
perform
 
tasks
 
more
 
easily
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
method
 
of
 
monitoring
 
students.
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
assist
 
administrators
 
in
 
managing
 
data
 
more
 
effectively
 
by
 
graphically
 
illustrating
 
student
 
performance.
 
 
Teachers,
  
the
 
system
 
aims
 
to
 
help
 
teachers
 
by
 
automatically
 
computing
 
grades
 
and
 
sending
 
early
 
intervention
 
alerts
 
to
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
failing.
 
This
 
reduces
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
spend
 
extra
 
time
 
repeatedly
 
notifying
 
students
 
about
 
their
 
academic
 
status.
 
 
 
Students,
 
the
 
students
 
will
 
benefit
 
from
 
the
 
system
 
by
 
receiving
 
notifications
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
failing.
 
This
 
allows
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
their
 
teachers
 
immediately
 
to
 
address
 
any
 
concerns.
 
They
 
can
 
also
 
make
 
up
 
for
 
missed
 
work
 
or
 
requirements
 
by
 
discussing
 
with
 
their
 
teachers
 
what
 
actions
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
take
 
to
 
avoid
 
failing
 
grades.
 
 
Resear chers,
 
the
 
researchers
 
will
 
benefit
 
from
 
the
 
system
 
as
 
it
 
helps
 
them
 
visualize
 
and
 
understand
 
problems
 
during
 
the
 
development
 
process.
 
It
 
also
 
supports
 
logical
 
thinking
 
when
 
dealing
 
with
 
system
 
errors
 
or
 
issues,
 
helping
 
them
 
improve
 
their
 
analytical
 
and
 
problem-solving
 
skills.
 
 
Futur e
 
Resear chers,
 
this
 
system
 
can
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
guide
 
or
 
reference
 
for
 
future
 
researchers.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
basis
 
for
 
their
 
own
 
research
 
studies,
 
especially
 
if
 
the
 
topic
 
is
 
related.
 
It
 
may
 
also
 
provide
 
helpful
 
data
 
and
 
additional
 
information
 
to
 
support
 
their
 
work.

SCOPE
 
AND
 
LIMITATION
 
 
The
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
develop
 
and
 
implement
 
a
 
Smart
 
Student
 
Monitoring
 
System
 
equipped
 
with
 
AI-powered
 
performance
 
analytics
 
and
 
early
 
intervention
 
alerts
 
developed
 
for
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy .
 
The
 
system
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
collect
 
and
 
analyze
 
student
 
academic
 
data
 
and
 
performance
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
identify
 
learning
 
trends
 
and
 
predict
 
potential
 
academic
 
risks.
 
Through
 
AI-driven
 
algorithms,
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
generate
 
alerts
 
when
 
students
 
show
 
signs
 
of
 
poor
 
academic
 
performance,
 
enabling
 
early
 
intervention
 
and
 
timely
 
support.
 
Data
 
privacy
 
and
 
user
 
authentication
 
will
 
be
 
prioritized
 
to
 
protect
 
students
 
and
 
teachers
 
information
 
throughout
 
the
 
monitoring
 
process.
 
 
This
 
study
 
is
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
internal
 
academic
 
monitoring
 
of
 
the
 
students
 
enrolled
 
at
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
cover
 
external
 
student
 
activities
 
or
 
personal
 
matters
 
outside
 
the
 
school
 
environment.
 
The
 
AI
 
model
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
system
 
relies
 
on
 
the
 
accuracy
 
and
 
completeness
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
stored
 
in
 
the
 
database;
 
therefore,
 
any
 
inaccurate
 
or
 
missing
 
data
 
may
 
reduce
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
analytics
 
and
 
alerts.
 
Additionally ,
 
real-time
 
classroom
 
behavior
 
monitoring
 
and
 
psychological
 
evaluations
 
are
 
outside
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
this
 
system.
 
The
 
initial
 
implementation
 
will
 
be
 
limited
 
to
 
select
 
grade
 
levels
 
and
 
subjects,
 
and
 
full
 
deployment
 
will
 
depend
 
on
 
further
 
testing
 
and
 
training
 
of
 
school
 
personnel.

presents
 
the
 
review
 
of
 
related
 
literature
 
and
 
studies
 
underlying
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
a
 
smart
 
student
 
monitoring
 
system
 
with
 
integrated
 
AI
 
analytics
 
and
 
early
 
intervention
 
alerts.
 
It
 
explores
 
existing
 
systems
 
and
 
research
 
efforts
 
related
 
to
 
academic
 
performance
 
tracking,
 
automated
 
monitoring
 
tools,
 
data
 
analytics
 
in
 
education,
 
and
 
alert-based
 
intervention
 
strategies.
 
TECHNICAL
 
BACKGROUND
 
 
 
The
 
front-end
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
developed
 
using
 
HTML,
 
CSS,
 
and
 
JavaScript.
 
HTML
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
structure
 
the
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
web
 
pages,
 
CSS
 
will
 
define
 
the
 
layout
 
and
 
appearance
 
of
 
elements,
 
and
 
JavaScript
 
will
 
make
 
the
 
system
 
interactive,
 
such
 
as
 
checking
 
if
 
a
 
form
 
is
 
filled
 
out
 
correctly
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
Visual
 
Studio
 
Code
 
(VS
 
Code)
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
integrated
 
development
 
environment
 
(IDE)
 
for
 
writing,
 
testing,
 
and
 
fixing
 
the
 
source
 
code.
 
It
 
is
 
chosen
 
because
 
it
 
supports
 
web
 
development
 
and
 
offers
 
helpful
 
extensions.
 
 
The
 
back-end
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
developed
 
using
 
XAMPP ,
 
which
 
includes
 
Apache
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
local
 
server ,
 
PHP
 
to
 
handle
 
the
 
system’ s
 
logic
 
and
 
user
 
actions,
 
and
 
MySQL
 
to
 
store
 
and
 
manage
 
student
 
records
 
such
 
as
 
grades,
 
attendance,
 
and
 
performance
 
data.
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
include
 
a
 
rule-based
 
AI
 
feature
 
that
 
automatically
 
checks
 
student
 
academic
 
data,
 
such
 
as
 
quiz
 
scores,
 
activities,
 
major
 
exam
 
results,
 
and
 
attendance.
 
If
 
a
 
student’ s
 
average
 
grade
 
falls
 
below
 
the
 
passing
 
mark,
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
send
 
an
 
alert
 
to
 
both
 
the
 
student
 
and
 
the
 
teacher .
 
This
 
helps
 
teachers
 
give
 
support
 
early
 
when
 
a
 
student
 
is
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
failing.

To
 
improve
 
the
 
system’ s
 
appearance
 
and

the
 
developers
 
will
 
use
 
Canva
 
to
 
design
 
icons,
 
banners,
 
and
 
other
 
visual
 
elements.
 
These
 
designs
 
will
 
help
 
make
 
the
 
system
 
easier
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
more
 
attractive
 
for
 
both
 
students
 
and
 
teachers.
 
The
 
team
 
will
 
also
 
use
 
Draw .io
 
to
 
create
 
system
 
diagrams,
 
including
 
Functional
 
Decomposition
 
Diagram
 
(FDD)
 
and
 
database
 
designs.
 
These
 
diagrams
 
will
 
help
 
explain
 
how
 
the
 
system
 
works
 
and
 
support
 
the
 
documentation
 
process.
 
 
During
 
testing
 
and
 
deployment,
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
installed
 
on
 
computers
 
or
 
laptops
 
with
 
average
 
hardware
 
specifications.
 
A
 
common
 
setup
 
may
 
include
 
an
 
Intel
 
Core
 
i5
 
processor ,
 
8GB
 
of
 
RAM,
 
and
 
a
 
solid-state
 
drive
 
(SSD)
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
system
 
running
 
smoothly .
 
Local
 
hosting
 
will
 
use
 
XAMPP
 
within
 
a
 
local
 
area
 
network
 
(LAN)
 
during
 
testing.
 
If
 
the
 
system
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
accessed
 
outside
 
the
 
school,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
uploaded
 
to
 
an
 
online
 
web
 
hosting
 
service.
 
Basic
 
networking
 
tools
 
like
 
Wi-Fi
 
routers
 
or
 
network
 
switches
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
connect
 
multiple
 
devices
 
within
 
the
 
school.

Learning
 
dashboards
 
that
 
gather
 
and
 
display
 
academic
 
data
 
in
 
one
 
platform
 
are
 
essential
 
in
 
modern
 
education.
 
These
 
tools
 
give
 
teachers
 
a
 
clearer
 
understanding
 
of
 
student
 
performance
 
by
 
providing
 
real-time
 
insights.
 
Through
 
visualized

instructors
 
can
 
make
 
timely
 
adjustments
 
to
 
their
 
teaching
 
strategies
 
to
 
better
 
match
 
students’
 
learning
 
styles.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
lessons
 
can
 
be
 
tailored
 
to
 
improve
 
individual
 
progress.
 
A
 
smart

system
 
integrates
 
these
 
dashboards
 
to
 
promote
 
more

have
 
shown
 
promise
 
in
 
identifying
 
students
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
failing
 
or
 
dropping
 
out.
 
By
 
analyzing
 
patterns
 
in
 
attendance,
 
performance,
 
and
 
engagement,
 
these
 
systems
 
provide
 
early
 
alerts
 
for
 
intervention.
 
Educators
 
can
 
use
 
these
 
alerts
 
to
 
take
 
proactive
 
steps,
 
such
 
as
 
offering
 
extra
 
help
 
or
 
counseling.
 
This
 
kind
 
of
 
technology
 
plays
 
an
 
important
 
role
 
in
 
student
 
monitoring
 
systems,
 
particularly
 
when
 
early
 
support
 
can
 
make
 
a
 
meaningful
 
difference.
 
Implementing
 
this
 
into
 
platforms
 
like
 
the
 
proposed
 
system
 
can
 
support
 
student
 
retention
 
and
 
success
 
[3].
 
Understanding
 
student
 
performance
 
requires
 
looking
 
beyond
 
test
 
scores.
 
Participation
 
in
 
class,
 
behavior
 
during
 
school
 
activities,
 
and
 
general
 
attitude
 
all
 
contribute
 
to
 
academic
 
development.
 
Smart
 
systems
 
that
 
combine
 
these
 
data
 
points
 
provide
 
a
 
more
 
complete
 
view
 
of
 
each
 
student.
 
They
 
allow
 
for
 
better
 
tracking
 
of
 
student
 
engagement
 
and
 
classroom
 
behavior .
 
These
 
insights
 
are
 
valuable
 
for

aiming
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
holistic
 
growth
 
of

The
 
rise
 
of
 
distance
 
learning
 
has
 
made
 
it
 
more
 
difficult
 
for
 
educators
 
to
 
monitor
 
student
 
progress.
 
Tools
 
that
 
offer
 
real-time
 
tracking
 
and
 
performance
 
reports
 
have
 
become
 
essential
 
in
 
remote
 
and
 
hybrid
 
settings.
 
Teachers
 
can
 
provide
 
timely
 
feedback
 
and
 
adjust
 
lesson
 
delivery
 
to
 
ensure
 
students
 
are
 
keeping
 
up.
 
This
 
is
 
especially
 
important
 
when
 
in-person
 
observation
 
is
 
limited.
 
Web-based
 
smart
 
monitoring
 
systems
 
fill
 
this
 
gap
 
by
 
providing
 
structure
 
and
 
oversight
 
in
 
all
 
learning
 
formats
 
[5].
 
Educational
 
institutions
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
data
 
mining
 
techniques
 
to
 
discover
 
hidden
 
patterns
 
in
 
student
 
records.
 
These
 
patterns
 
help
 
identify
 
learners
 
who
 
may
 
require
 
additional
 
academic
 
support.
 
Through
 
targeted
 
interventions,
 
teachers
 
can
 
address
 
these
 
needs
 
more
 
effectively .
 
Smart
 
systems
 
that
 
include

This
 
promotes
 
better
 
outcomes
 
across
 
the
 
school
 
[6].
 
Systems
 
that
 
are
 
accessible
 
through
 
the
 
web
 
make
 
student
 
monitoring
 
more
 
efficient

information
 
that
 
helps
 
track
 
both
 
progress
 
and
 
challenges.
 
With
 
a
 
well-designed
 
interface,
 
web-based
 
systems
 
improve
 
school
 
organization.
 
They
 
are
 
an
 
essential

are
 
vital
 
in
 
systems
 
like
 
the
 
one
 
proposed

early ,
 
these
 
tools
 
help
 
teachers
 
intervene
 
before

their
 
value.
 
They
 
promote
 
smarter
 
systems
 
capable
 
of
 
adapting
 
to
 
each

[9].
 
When
 
real-time
 
data
 
is
 
available,
 
teachers
 
can
 
make
 
instant
 
changes
 
during
 
lessons.
 
This
 
allows
 
for
 
more
 
dynamic
 
classroom

understanding.
 
A
 
responsive
 
teaching
 
approach
 
helps
 
maintain
 
focus
 
and
 
improves

systems
 
are
 
vital
 
in
 
any
 
smart
 
student
 
monitoring
 
solution
 
[10].
 
AI-supported
 
platforms
 
can
 
centralize
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
student
 
monitoring
 
such
 
as
 
test
 
results,
 
attendance,
 
and
 
behavioral

Having
 
this
 
information
 
in
 
one
 
place
 
simplifies
 
the
 
task
 
of
 
tracking
 
student
 
progress.
 
It

They
 
are
 
particularly
 
useful
 
in
 
developing

AI
 
systems
 
can
 
analyze
 
large
 
volumes
 
of
 
student
 
data,
 
such
 
as
 
attendance
 
records,
 
grades,
 
and
 
behavioral
 
patterns,
 
to
 
recognize
 
signs
 
of
 
declining
 
performance
 
before
 
they
 
become
 
critical.
 
These
 
technologies
 
not
 
only
 
support
 
educators
 
in
 
making
 
informed
 
decisions
 
but
 
also
 
help
 
institutions
 
create
 
more
 
inclusive
 
and
 
responsive
 
learning
 
environments.
 
By
 
integrating
 
AI
 
into
 
student
 
monitoring
 
platforms,
 
schools
 
can
 
enhance
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
support
 
learners
 
more
 
effectively
 
and
 
promote
 
better
 
academic
 
outcomes
 
[12].
 
Early
 
warning
 
systems
 
are
 
helpful
 
in
 
spotting
 
students
 
who
 
might
 
fall
 
behind.
 
They
 
are
 
especially
 
important
 
in
 
virtual
 
learning
 
setups
 
where
 
student
 
activity
 
is
 
harder
 
to
 
track.
 
These
 
tools
 
notify
 
educators
 
of
 
concerning
 
trends
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
act
 
quickly .
 
Timely
 
interventions
 
help
 
prevent
 
long-term
 
academic
 
problems.
 
Schools
 
like
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy
 
can
 
enhance
 
student
 
support
 
using
 
this
 
approach
 
[13].
 
While
 
AI
 
systems
 
offer
 
useful
 
insights,
 
they
 
may
 
also
 
affect
 
how
 
students
 
feel
 
about
 
being
 
monitored.
 
Continuous
 
observation
 
could
 
make
 
some
 
learners
 
uncomfortable.
 
It's
 
important
 
to
 
implement
 
such
 
technologies
 
with
 
clear
 
communication
 
and
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
support.
 
A
 
well-balanced
 
system
 
ensures
 
students
 
feel
 
safe
 
and
 
respected.
 
With
 
the
 
right
 
approach,
 
smart
 
monitoring
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
both
 
improved
 
performance
 
and
 
student
 
well-being
 
[14].
 
RELA TED

A
 
school-based
 
web
 
system
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
improve
 
how
 
student
 
records
 
are
 
handled.
 
It
 
made
 
administrative
 
tasks
 
faster
 
and
 
allowed
 
better
 
tracking
 
of
 
academic
 
performance.
 
By
 
organizing
 
student
 
data
 
in
 
a
 
central
 
platform,
 
the
 
school
 
could
 
make
 
more
 
accurate
 
plans
 
and
 
provide
 
targeted
 
interventions.
 
This
 
not

like
 
these
 
show
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
web-based
 
tools
 
in
 
educational
 
settings
 
[15].
 
Tracking
 
systems
 
that
 
deliver
 
updates
 
in
 
real
 
time
 
allow
 
teachers
 
to
 
adjust
 
their
 
methods
 
without

When
 
students
 
need
 
support,
 
they
 
can
 
get
 
help
 
right
 
away
 
instead
 
of
 
waiting
 
for
 
formal
 
assessments.
 
This
 
kind
 
of
 
flexibility
 
improves
 
teaching
 
quality
 
and
 
student
 
outcomes.
 
It
 
also
 
reduces
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
repetitive
 
tasks.
 
Schools
 
using
 
such
 
systems
 
report
 
better

that
 
teachers
 
can
 
use
 
to

by
 
a
 
school
 
in
 
the
 
Philippines,
 
leading
 
to
 
better

encouraged
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
consistent
 
in
 
their

The
 
tool
 
also

Such
 
improvements
 
support
 
smoother
 
school

[18].
 
AI
 
in
 
education
 
brings
 
many
 
benefits,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
raises
 
some
 
concerns.
 
While
 
it
 
improves
 
learning

and
 
offers
 
new
 
insights,
 
some

A
 
thoughtful
 
balance
 
protects
 
student
 
welfare
 
while
 
using
 
technology
 
for

[19].
 
A
 
smart

was
 
designed
 
to
 
watch
 
over
 
student
 
progress
 
and
 
generate

for
 
those
 
at

This
 
helped
 
schools
 
step
 
in
 
before
 
problems
 
worsened,
 
improving
 
academic
 
success
 
rates.
 
Teachers
 
could
 
prioritize
 
support
 
where
 
it
 
was
 
needed
 
most.
 
The
 
system
 
proved
 
useful
 
in

high
 
standards.
 
Early

are
 
now
 
essential
 
in
 
effective

[20].
 
AI
 
models
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
predict
 
future
 
grades
 
and
 
behavioral
 
trends
 
in
 
students.
 
This
 
predictive
 
capability
 
helped
 
schools
 
intervene
 
before
 
academic
 
or
 
behavioral
 
issues
 
became
 
serious.
 
Teachers
 
could
 
develop
 
better
 
instructional
 
plans
 
tailored
 
to
 
students'
 
needs.
 
Such
 
features
 
are
 
powerful
 
tools
 
in
 
ensuring
 
continuous
 
improvement.
 
These
 
applications
 
form
 
the
 
backbone
 
of
 
AI-powered
 
education
 
systems
 
[21].
 
Tools
 
that
 
identify
 
struggling
 
students
 
before
 
issues
 
become
 
severe
 
are
 
changing
 
classroom
 
management.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
no
 
longer
 
limited
 
to
 
reacting
 
after
 
failure

Instead,
 
they
 
can

it.
 
These
 
systems
 
allow
 
for
 
more

REQUIREMENTS
 
ANAL YSIS
 
In
 
this
 
section,
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
current
 
process
 
and
 
specific
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
organization,
 
specifically
 
in
 
monitoring
 
student
 
performance.
 
By
 
conducting
 
interviews
 
with
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
reviewing
 
the
 
existing
 
systems
 
and
 
procedures,
 
the
 
proponents
 
aim
 
to
 
gain
 
a
 
complete
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
school’ s
 
operations
 
and
 
objectives.
 
The
 
key
 
individuals
 
involved
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
include
 
teachers
 
and
 
school
 
administrators,
 
as
 
each
 
plays
 
an
 
important
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
academic
 
monitoring
 
process.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
responsible
 
for
 
recording
 
student
 
grades,
 
managing
 
class
 
records,
 
and
 
submitting
 
final
 
grades.
 
School
 
administrators
 
review
 
and
 
monitor
 
these
 
records
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
academic
 
standing
 
of
 
students.
 
 
 
The
 
main
 
activity
 
being
 
monitored
 
is
 
student
 
academic
 
performance.
 
This
 
includes
 
tracking
 
grades
 
in
 
quizzes,
 
written
 
works,
 
performance
 
tasks,
 
final
 
exams,
 
and
 
attendance.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
student
 
data
 
is
 
up
 
to
 
date,
 
accurate,
 
and
 
accessible
 
for
 
both
 
teaching
 
and
 
administrative
 
purposes.
 
The
 
process
 
also
 
helps
 
in
 
identifying
 
students
 
who
 
may
 
be
 
at
 
risk
 
or
 
require
 
academic
 
support.
 
 
The
 
process
 
takes
 
place
 
within
 
St.
 
Ignatius
 
Academy ,
 
a
 
private
 
educational
 
institution
 
located
 
at

Once
 
the

the

to
 
the
 
school
 
administrators.
 
The
 
current
 
process
 
combines
 
both
 
manual
 
and
 
digital
 
methods.
 
Teachers
 
use
 
physical

books
 
to
 
write
 
down
 
student
 
performance

attendance.
 
Some
 
also

to
 
compute
 
and
 
summarize
 
grades.
 
Once

the
 
different
 
stages
 
and
 
processes
 
involved
 
in
 
achieving
 
the
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
study .
 
The
 
Input
 
phase
 
consists
 
of
 
knowledge,
 
software,
 
and
 
hardware
 
requirements.
 
The
 
knowledge
 
requirements
 
include
 
web-based
 
monitoring
 
systems,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
AI
 
in
 
educational
 
analytics,
 
tracking

The
 
hardware
 
requirements
 
include
 
desktop
 
computers,
 
laptops,
 
and
 
internet
 
connectivity
 
through
 
a
 
router
 
or

The
 
software
 
requirements
 
consist
 
of
 
development
 
tools
 
and
 
technologies
 
such
 
as
 
HTML,
 
CSS,
 
JavaScript,
 
Bootstrap,
 
PHP
 
or
 
Python
 
for
 
the

Code,
 
and
 
AI/ML
 
frameworks
 
such
 
as
 
Scikit-learn

which
 
includes
 
the
 
phases
 
of
 
requirements
 
gathering
 
and
 
planning,
 
system
 
design,
 
development,

The
 
Output
 
of
 
this
 
framework
 
is

to
 
support
 
and
 
improve
 
student
 
monitoring
 
and
 
academic
 
performance
 
at
 
St.
 
Ignatius

Additionally ,
 
an
 
evaluation
 
loop
 
is
 
incorporated
 
into
 
the
 
framework
 
to
 
ensure
 
continuous
 
improvement.
 
It
 
involves
 
collecting
 
user
 
feedback
 
from
 
the
 
deployed
 
system
 
and
 
applying
 
necessary
 
updates
 
and
 
adjustments.
 
This
 
helps
 
maintain
 
the
 
system’ s
 
functionality ,
 
user-friendliness,
 
and
 
adaptability
 
to
 
changing
 
needs.

At
 
the
 
user
 
level,
 
both
 
administrators
 
and
 
teachers
 
use
 
the
 
system
 
through
 
their
 
own
 
web-based
 
user
 
interfaces
 
on
 
their
 
computers.
 
These
 
interfaces
 
are
 
easy
 
to
 
use
 
and
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
way
 
to
 
enter
 
and
 
view
 
information.
 
They
 
connect
 
to
 
the
 
system
 
over
 
the
 
internet,
 
which
 
links
 
the
 
users'
 
devices
 
to
 
the
 
main
 
system.
 
The
 
main
 
system
 
runs
 
on
 
a
 
combined
 
web
 
server
 
and
 
application
 
server .
 
This
 
server
 
handles
 
the
 
user
 
interfaces,
 
runs
 
the
 
system's
 
features,
 
and
 
most
 
importantly ,
 
uses
 
AI
 
to
 
analyze
 
student
 
data.
 
It
 
identifies
 
patterns
 
or
 
signs
 
of
 
poor
 
performance
 
and
 
sends
 
early
 
warning
 
alerts
 
when
 
needed.
 
All
 
student
 
records,
 
performance
 
data,
 
attendance,
 
and
 
system
 
settings
 
are
 
stored
 
in
 
the
 
database.
 
This
 
database
 
keeps
 
all
 
the
 
information
 
organized
 
and
 
available
 
for
 
both
 
users
 
and
 
the
 
AI
 
system
 
to
 
use.
 
The
 
overall
 
design
 
makes
 
sure
 
that
 
data
 
flows
 
smoothly
 
from
 
input
 
to
 
storage,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
action.
 
This
 
makes
 
the
 
system
 
a
 
helpful
 
tool
 
for
 
supporting
 
students
 
at
 
St.
 
Ignatius

would
 
be
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
actual
 
needs
 
of
 
its
 
intended
 
users.
 
Phase
 
2:
 
Design
 
 
Once
 
the
 
requirements
 
were
 
established,
 
the
 
researchers
 
began
 
designing
 
the
 
system’ s

user
 
interface
 
and
 
overall
 
layout.
 
The
 
design
 
aimed
 
to
 
be
 
simple,
 
intuitive,
 
and
 
user-friendly ,
 
especially
 
for
 
individuals
 
who
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
highly
 
familiar
 
with
 
technology .
 
Wireframes
 
and
 
mockups
 
were
 
created
 
to
 
visualize
 
the
 
structure
 
and
 
flow
 
of
 
the
 
system.
 
This
 
phase
 
focused
 
on
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
design
 
would
 
support
 
a
 
smooth
 
user
 
experience.
 
Phase
 
3:
 
Development
 
 
During
 
the
 
development
 
phase,
 
the
 
system
 
was
 
built
 
gradually ,
 
following
 
the
 
planned
 
features
 
from
 
the
 
previous
 
phases.
 
Key
 
modules
 
such
 
as
 
student
 
information
 
entry ,
 
AI-powered
 
performance
 
analysis,
 
real-time
 
alerts,
 
and
 
administrative
 
dashboards
 
were
 
developed
 
and
 
implemented.
 
Phase
 
4:
 
Testing
 
 
In
 
this
 
phase,
 
each
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
was
 
tested
 
to
 
ensure
 
it
 
functioned
 
correctly
 
and
 
met
 
the
 
expected
 
requirements.
 
The
 
team
 
performed
 
functionality
 
checks,
 
fixed
 
identified
 
errors,
 
and
 
ensured
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
was
 
easy
 
to
 
use.
 
Feedback
 
from
 
sample
 
users,
 
including
 
teachers,
 
was
 
also
 
gathered
 
to
 
identify
 
usability
 
issues
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement.
 
This
 
phase
 
helped
 
ensure
 
the
 
system’ s
 
quality
 
and
 
reliability
 
before
 
deployment.
 
Phase
 
5:
 
Deployment
 
 
After
 
successful
 
testing,
 
the
 
system
 
was
 
deployed
 
to
 
a
 
live
 
server
 
environment
 
where
 
it
 
became
 
accessible
 
to
 
users.
 
The
 
researchers
 
ensured
 
that
 
all
 
core
 
functions
 
were
 
stable
 
and
 
that
 
users
 
could
 
begin
 
using
 
the
 
system
 
for
 
real
 
tasks.
 
Basic
 
user
 
guidance
 
and
 
support
 
were
 
also
 
provided
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
navigate
 
the
 
system
 
effectively .
 
This
 
phase
 
marked
 
the
 
official
 
launch
 
and
 
readiness
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
for
 
day-to-day
 
use.

Phase
 
6:
 
Review
 
 
The
 
final
 
phase
 
involved
 
reviewing
 
the
 
entire
 
development
 
process
 
and
 
evaluating
 
the
 
system’ s
 
performance
 
based
 
on
 
user
 
feedback.
 
The
 
researchers
 
gathered
 
comments
 
and
 
suggestions
 
to
 
determine
 
if
 
the
 
system
 
was
 
meeting
 
its
 
objectives
 
and
 
to
 
identify
 
any
 
areas
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
improved
 
in
 
future
 
updates.
 
This
 
ongoing
 
review
 
supports
 
the
 
continuous
 
enhancement
 
of
 
the
 
system,
 
ensuring
 
it
 
remains
 
relevant
 
and
 
useful
 
to
 
its
 
users.

tool
 
that
 
measures
 
the
 
satisfaction
 
level
 
of

This
 
allows
 
developers
