# User Management System

## Overview

The student monitoring system now implements a proper user management system where administrators have full control over user account creation and approval. This ensures security and proper access control.

## User Registration Flow

### 1. Students
- **Self-Registration**: Students can register themselves through the public registration form
- **Status**: Accounts are created with `pending` status
- **Approval Required**: Admin must approve before students can log in
- **Notification**: Students receive a message that their account is pending approval

### 2. Teachers
- **Admin-Only Creation**: Teachers cannot self-register
- **Created by Admin**: Only administrators can create teacher accounts
- **Immediate Access**: Teacher accounts are created with `active` status
- **No Approval Needed**: Teachers can log in immediately after creation

### 3. Parents
- **Admin-Only Creation**: Parents cannot self-register
- **Student Linking**: Parents must be linked to specific students
- **Relationship Tracking**: System tracks relationship (father, mother, guardian)
- **Immediate Access**: Parent accounts are created with `active` status

### 4. Administrators
- **Admin-Only Creation**: Only existing admins can create new admin accounts
- **Immediate Access**: Admin accounts are created with `active` status
- **Full Permissions**: Admins have complete system access

## Database Changes

### Users Table Updates
```sql
-- New columns added to users table
status ENUM('pending','active','suspended') DEFAULT 'pending'
requested_role ENUM('admin','teacher','adviser','student','parent') NULL
approved_by INT UNSIGNED NULL
approved_at TIMESTAMP NULL
```

### Parents Table Updates
```sql
-- New columns added to parents table
student_id INT UNSIGNED NULL
relationship ENUM('father','mother','guardian') DEFAULT 'guardian'
```

## Admin Dashboard Features

## User Workflows

### Student Registration Workflow

2. Fills out registration form
3. Account created with `pending` status
4. Student sees "pending approval" message
5. Admin reviews in `/admin/users`
6. Admin approves or rejects
7. If approved, student can log in

### Teacher/Adviser Creation Workflow
1. Teacher/Adviser registers at `/register` (or admin can approve pending registrations)
2. Account created with `pending` status
3. Admin reviews in `/admin/users`
4. Admin approves the registration
5. Role-specific records (teacher/adviser) are automatically created upon approval
6. Teacher/Adviser can log in after approval

### Parent Creation Workflow
1. Admin goes to `/admin/create-parent`
2. Selects student to link parent to
3. Fills out parent details and relationship
